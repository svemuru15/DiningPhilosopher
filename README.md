# Dining Philosophers Problem

Group: Sritan Vemuru, Ansh Desai, Arya Bharti

We first created a class to represent the philosophers. This class extends Thread, and it has the variables to show how many forks the philosopher has at a time. This determines whether he is eating or thinking. To represent the forks we simply used a general Object, and we created an array to store all the forks on the table. The spaghetti is not explicitly stated, but it is the eating phase of the philosopher. In order to represent the thinking phase we have the sleeping portion of the thread. The eating phase is shown when there is an action and we have both forks. Our algorithm helps prevent deadlocks and starvation, but it is still possible. It is just extremely improbable. The main way that we try to prevent deadlock is by making all the philosophers pick up their left fork first while the last philosopher picks up his right fork first. This reduces the probability of deadlock significantly making it very improbable. We have the randomness for our sleeping portion of the thread which is between 50-150 seconds. This variability makes it highly unlikely that a philosopher starves, but there is still a chance. We could help this by making a set number of times or meals that a philosopher eats so that once they are done they no longer need to eat anymore which would make sure no philosopher starves.
